Therefore, there is an evident need to provide non-expert users with the ability to customize in a simple but effective way the behaviour of these devices based on their preferences and habits. This paper presents RuleBot, a conversational agent that uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to allow end users to create automations according to a flexible implementation of the trigger-action paradigm, and thereby customize the behaviour of devices and sensors using natural language. In particular, the paper describes the design and implementation of RuleBot, and reports on a user test and lessons learnt.",Tool Tech,YES,Unspecified,Smart objects and environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531073.3531090,,Italy,WEIRD,,
2,10.1145/3567512.3567527,A Language-Parametric Approach to Exploratory Programming Environments,"Exploratory programming is a software development style in which code is a medium for prototyping ideas and solutions, and in which even the end-goal can evolve over time. Exploratory programming is valuable in various contexts such as programming education, data science, and end-user programming. However, there is a lack of appropriate tooling and language design principles to support exploratory programming. This paper presents a host language- and object language-independent protocol for exploratory programming akin to the Language Server Protocol. The protocol serves as a basis to develop novel (or extend existing) programming environments for exploratory programming such as computational notebooks and command-line REPLs. An architecture is presented on top of which prototype environments can be developed with relative ease, because existing (language) components can be reused. Our prototypes demonstrate that the proposed protocol is sufficiently expressive to support exploratory programming scenarios as encountered in literature within the software engineering, human-computer interaction and data science domains.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,Programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3567512.3567527,,"Netherlands, France",WEIRD,,
3,10.1145/3550356.3561588,A Low-Code Approach to Support Method Engineering,"Method engineering is defined as a discipline to design, construct and adapt methods, techniques and tools for the development of information systems. A method formalizes and structures the steps needed in order to achieve a specific goal. By executing a method step by step, users follow a systematic and well defined way to attain the results which the method was created for. However, method creation or the adaptation of existing methods to a specific domain or organization is challenging if one does not have method engineering skills. In addition, the adoption of a method may also be difficult if there is no tool to support these activities. Method engineers may not have the programming skills to implement such a tool. In this context, we propose an approach inspired by the low-code and end-user development paradigms for method engineering. The advantages are twofold. Firstly, it helps method engineers in creating and configuring new methods. Secondly, the approach automatically provides tool support so that method experts can actually execute the method. This position paper presents the approach through a proof of concept implementation.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,Programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3550356.3561588,,France,WEIRD,,

These systems provide domain specific languages that require both business knowledge and programming skills to effectively use. As such, business users often lack adequate programming skills to fully leverage these code oriented environments. We propose a paradigm for the construction of business automations using natural language. The approach applies a large language model to translate business rules and automations described in natural language, into a domain specific language interpretable by a business rule engine.

We also witness a growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, allowing digital user interfaces (UIs) to communicate with physical objects and vice versa through so-called hybrid user interfaces. There exist various solutions to manage adaptive, distributed or hybrid UIs. However, none of them covers all three aspects and users have to deal with multiple applications and configurations when developing adaptive distributed hybrid user interfaces. We introduce the eSPACE reference framework and conceptual model unifying the domains of adaptive, distributed and hybrid interfaces. While our reference framework has been inspired by the CAMELEON reference framework, the conceptual model is based on the Resource-Selector-Link (RSL) hypermedia metamodel. We propose an approach for adaptive distributed hybrid user interfaces where users can author their user interfaces based on the different levels of abstraction introduced by our reference framework.

This can be achieved through Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning. Planning is intended as the ability of a WoT system to construct a sequence of actions, that when executed by the smart devices, achieves an effect on the environment in response to an end user issued goal. The problem of planning specifically for the WoT domain has not been sufficiently dealt with in the existing literature. The existing planning approaches do not deal with one or more of the following important factors in the context of WoT: (1) random unexpected events (2) unpredictable device effects leading to side effects at runtime, and (3) durative effects. In this work, we propose a cyclic planning system which adopted a PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) process solution to deal with the existing shortcomings for continuous improvement. The planner employs domain knowledge based on the WoTDL (Web of Things Description Language) ontology.The cyclic planner enables continuous plan monitoring to cope with inconsistencies with user issued goals.

End-user programming of industrial robots has become an essential capability for all areas in industry. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of block-based programming languages for large and complex robot programs. Therefore, we implemented a real-world program for industrial robots using Blockly, a block-based visual language, and assessed the results regarding portability, readability, understandability, and maintainability. Our findings are, that (1) large and complex real-world robot programs can be expressed in Blockly, (2) that the readability and understandability of such programs is equal to conventional flow-chart based programming languages, and (3) that the maintainability of Blockly programs can even be considered better than in flowchart based languages.

Although these rules are easy to program, subtleties in their interpretation can cause users to make errors that have consequences ranging from incorrect and undesired functionality to security and privacy violations. Based on prior work, we enumerate a set of nine classes of errors that users can make, and we empirically study the relationship between these classes and the interface design of eight commercially available trigger-action platforms. Particularly, we examine whether each interface prevents (e.g., via good design) or allows each class of error. Based on this analysis, we develop a framework to classify errors and extract insights that lay a foundation for the design of future trigger-action programming interfaces where certain classes of errors can be mitigated by technical means or by alerting the user of the possibility of an error. For instance, we identify that an analysis of a dataset of functionally-similar trigger-action rules could be used to predict whether certain types of error patterns are about to occur.",Empirical Studies,NO,NA,Smart objects and environments,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8844640,,USA,WEIRD,,

accomplished by non-programmers. Often these non-programmers use visual languages to specify the
robot’s and/or machine’s control logic. While visual languages are explored as a means to enable
novices to program, there is little understanding of what problems novices face when tasked with
realistic adaptation programming tasks on the shop floor. In this paper, we report the results of a
controlled experiment where domain experts in the injection molding industry inspected and changed
realistic programs involving a robot, injection molding machine, and additional external machines. We
found that participants were comparably quick to understand the program behavior with a familiar
sequential function chart-based language and a Blockly-based language used for the first time. We
also observed that these non-programmers had difficulty in multiple aspects independent of language
due to the interweaving of physical and software-centric interaction between robot and machine.

19,10.5555/3523760.3523864,Authoring Human Simulators via Probabilistic Functional Reactive Program Synthesis,"One of the core challenges in creating interactive behaviors for social robots is testing. Programs implementing the interactive behaviors require real humans to test and this requirement makes testing of the programs extremely expensive. To address this problem, human-robot interaction researchers in the past proposed using human simulators. However, human simulators are tedious to set up and context-dependent and therefore are not widely used in practice. We propose a program synthesis approach to building human simulators for the purpose of testing interactive robot programs. Our key ideas are (1) representing human simulators as probabilistic functional reactive programming programs and (2) using probabilistic inference for synthesizing human simulator programs. Programmers then will be able to build human simulators by providing interaction traces between a robot and a human or two humans which they can later use to test interactive robot programs and improve or tweak as needed.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,Robots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/3523760.3523864,,USA,WEIRD,,

These LIS operate as per the company's business rules that are formally specified in Calculation Specification (CS) sheets. To meet ever-changing business demands, insurance companies are increasingly trans-forming their outdated LIS to modern Policy Administration Systems (PAS). Quality Assurance (QA) of such PAS involves manual validation of calculations' implementation against the corresponding CS sheets from the LIS. This manual QA approach is effort-intensive and error-prone, which may fail to detect inconsistencies in PAS implementations and ultimately result in monetary loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel low-code/no-code technique to automatically validate PAS imple-mentation against CS sheets. Our technique has been evaluated on a digital transformation project of a large insurance company on 12 real-world calculations through 254 policies.

AutoTap translates these properties to linear temporal logic (LTL) and both automatically synthesizes property-satisfying TAP rules from scratch and repairs existing TAP rules. We designed AutoTap based on a user study about properties users wish to express.

These devices provide convenience, yet can introduce issues related to safety, security, and usability. To better understand device owners' recent negative experiences with widely deployed smart devices and how those experiences impact the ability to provide a safe environment for users, we conducted an online, survey-based study of 72 participants who have smart devices in their own home. Participants reported struggling to diagnose and recover from power outages and network failures, misattributing some events to hacking. For devices featuring built-in learning, participants reported difficulty avoiding false alarms, communicating complex schedules, and resolving conflicting preferences.

24,10.1145/3563835.3567668,Bridging the Syntax-Semantics Gap of Programming,"Computer programming typically requires people to describe operations in a formally specified textual language. Unfortunately, working with syntax is a significant cognitive load, making programming difficult for beginners and time-consuming for professional developers. In response to this, contemporary research often focuses on abstracting or improving the process of composing code. We believe, however, that one fundamental reason why programming is difficult is the disconnect between the symbols and metaphors used in code and the mechanics they represent. Programming languages use abstractions whose superficial similarities to natural language neither effectively help users understand programs nor enable them to work creatively. To tackle this fundamental limitation, this paper introduces a new language based on a novel programming-by-demonstration paradigm that (i) enables users to experiment and test their programs, (ii) allows describing complex operations without the need to learn any syntax, and (iii) always displays an approximation of the program state while programming a new operation.

Several tools and platforms have been proposed to create the art devices. However, the interactive artworks are typically developed with these art devices in ad hoc approaches, and the artists need to spend significant programming efforts to integrate the art devices. This paper proposes CATtalk, a platform to create and maintain interactive artworks. The novel idea is to treat all art devices in an interactive artwork as IoT devices that can be transparently reused by reconfiguration in CATtalk. Therefore, the artworks developed independently by individual artists can be quickly integrated to create new interactive applications. Through CATtalk’s no-code and low-code mechanisms, the artists can manipulate CATtalk with little or no programing efforts. CATtalk offers a built-in mechanism so that any person in the audience can play with an interactive artwork with his/her smartphone. We also conduct analytic analysis, simulation and measurements to ensure that the interactive art performance in cross-country remote stages are not affected by the communications delays. In our measurements, the average local and remote communication delays are about 0.01 and 0.05 seconds, respectively. If the art performance is designed such that the average delay between two actions of a local (remote) performer is longer than 0.1 seconds, then the probability of out-of-sequence actions is less than 0.01%. That is, the local dancer should perform slower than the remote dancer.

To automate the application of these refactorings, we enhance the Scratch programming environment with powerful program analysis and transformation routines. To evaluate the utility of these refactorings, we apply them to remove the code smells detected in a representative dataset of 448 Scratch projects.

To personalize learning on a massive scale, social bots can be used as supporting technology. However, their development for virtual learning environments currently requires deep technical knowledge. This leaves learner communities relying on highly-skilled developers to generate and tailor these social bots. Participatory design, end-user development and model-driven principles bear the potential to close this technical gap. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for creating social bots. Using our framework, learners can create, train and utilize these for self-hosted virtual learning environments relying on OpenAPI specifications offered, e.g. by Blackboard. We support both retrieval-based bots that react to certain events in predefined ways, as well as generative bots by utilizing open source deep learning technologies. Our first evaluation shows the usefulness of model-driven generation and utilization of social bots.

Understanding Human-Cobot Interactions in Automation,"Collaborative robots, or cobots, represent a breakthrough technology designed for high-level (e.g. collaborative) interactions between workers and robots with capabilities for flexible deployment in industries such as manufacturing. Understanding how workers and companies use and integrate cobots is important to inform the future design of cobot systems and educational technologies that facilitate effective worker-cobot interaction. Yet, little is known about typical training for collaboration and the application of cobots in manufacturing. To close this gap, we interviewed nine experts in manufacturing about their experience with cobots. Our thematic analysis revealed that, contrary to the envisioned use, experts described most cobot applications as only low-level (e.g. pressing start/stop buttons) interactions with little flexible deployment, and experts felt traditional Robotics skills were needed for collaborative and flexible interaction with cobots.

It aims to reduce user's workload and to let the user program the robot faster than in classical approaches (e.g. kinesthetic teaching). The proposed approach, where user is using a mixed-reality HMD - Microsoft HoloLens - and touch-enabled table with SAR projected interface as input devices, is compared to a baseline approach, where robot's arms and a touch-enabled table are used as input devices. Main advantages of the proposed approach are the possibility to program the collaborative workspace without the presence of the robot, its speed in comparison to the kinesthetic teaching and an ability to quickly visualize learned program instructions, in form of virtual objects, to enhance the users' orientation within those programs. The approach was evaluated on a set of 20 users using the within-subject experiment design. Evaluation consisted of two pick and place tasks, where users had to start from the scratch as well as to update the existing program.

End-user programming of industrial robots has become an essential capability for all areas in industry. Consequently, different visual programming languages have found their way into the domain of industrial robot programming. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of block-based programming languages for large and complex robot programs in realistic environments. Here, a key aspect of robot programming is not only the interaction with the physical environment, but also the robot's interaction with other shopfloor participants at the software control level. To this end, we analysed the requirements for programming a robot based a real world production cell and implemented the necessary programming constructs using Blockly, an open-source block-based visual language. We assessed the results comparing the implementation of a change in Blockly and the Sequential Function Chart-based language. We find that while Blockly is able to express large and complex real-world robot programs, a major contributing factor is not just the language itself but the presentation of the robot's run-time environment as well as support by the development environment (i.e., editor).

Citizen development represents a novel software engineering paradigm which enables and supports the development of software by non-IT professionals, consequently referred to as ‘citizen developers’. While there is a vivid discourse on citizen development in the practice community, research on this phenomenon is still scarce.

In this context, we propose a formal development framework based on the Web of Things specification. An application is defined using a composition language that allows users to compose the basic event-action rules to express complex scenarios. It is transformed into a formal specification that serves as the input for formal analysis, where the application is checked for functional and quantitative properties at design time using model checking techniques. Once the application is validated, it can be deployed and the rules are executed following the composition language semantics.

Therefore, end-user solutions supporting users in solving (simple) robot programming tasks without expert knowledge are a promising research field. A possibility for these solutions is the inclusion of Augmented Reality (AR) to enable users to work in the robot space, reducing the amount of mentally taxing coordinate space conversions. Approaches for this mainly rely on the waypoint-based robot path programming strategy. To explore an alternative solution, we propose an AR-assisted approach with different possible path-planning strategies, such as drawing paths or selecting single waypoints directly in the real world. This enables end-users without a programming background to program paths for a wheeled mobile robot. They can also see and edit their programmed paths in a Blockly-like representation. Furthermore, we offer AR in-place program simulation and direct building of finished programs to the real robot. We evaluated our approach regarding usability compared to existing non-AR end-user software as well as comparing the two different path-planning strategies to each other.

59,10.3390/s22134942,DeviceTalk: A No-Code Low-Code IoT Device Code Generation,"The deployment of a client–server-based distributed intelligent system involves application development in both the network domain and the device domain. In the network domain, an application server (typically in the cloud) is deployed to execute the network applications. In the device domain, several Internet of Things (IoT) devices may be configured as, for example, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and interact with each other through the application server. Developing the network and the device applications are tedious tasks that are the major costs for building a distributed intelligent system. To resolve this issue, a low-code or no-code (LCNC) approach has been purposed to automate code generation. As traditional LCNC solutions are highly generic, they tend to generate excess code and instructions, which will lack efficiency in terms of storage and processing. Fortunately, optimization of automated code generation can be achieved for IoT by taking advantage of the IoT characteristics. An IoT-based distributed intelligent system consists of the device domain (IoT devices) and the network domain (IoT server). The software of an IoT device in the device domain consists of the Device Application (DA) and the Sensor Application (SA). Most IoT LCNC approaches provide code generation in the network domain. Very few approaches automatically generate the DA code. To our knowledge, no approach supports the SA code generation. In this paper, we propose DeviceTalk, an LCNC environment for the DA and the SA code development. DeviceTalk automatically generates the code for IoT devices to speed up the software development in the device domain for a distributed intelligent system. We propose the DeviceTalk architecture, design and implementation of the code generation mechanism for the IoT devices. Then, we show how a developer can use the DeviceTalk Graphical User Interface (GUI) to exercise LCNC development of the device software.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,Smart objects and environments,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361726704_DeviceTalk_A_No-Code_Low-Code_IoT_Device_Code_Generation,,Taiwan,Non-WEIRD,,yes

To author reliable statistical analyses, integrating knowledge about the domain, data, statistics, and programming is necessary. However, this is an unrealistic expectation for many analysts who may possess domain expertise but lack statistical or programming expertise, including many researchers, policy makers, and other data scientists. How can our statistical software help these analysts? To address this need, we first probed into the cognitive and operational processes involved in authoring statistical analyses and developed the theory of hypothesis formalization. Authoring statistical analyses is a dual-search process that requires grappling with assumptions about conceptual relationships and iterating on statistical model implementations. This led to our key insight: statistical software needs to help analysts translate what they know about their domain and data into statistical modeling programs. To do so, statistical software must provide programming interfaces and interaction models that allow statistical non-experts to express their analysis goals accurately and reflect on their domain knowledge and data. Thus far, we have developed two such systems that embody this insight: Tea and Tisane. Ongoing work on rTisane explores new semantics for more accurately eliciting analysis intent and conceptual knowledge. Additionally, we are planning a summative evaluation of rTisane to assess our hypothesis that this new way of authoring statistical analyses makes domain experts more aware of their implicit assumptions, able to author and understand nuanced statistical models that answer their research questions, and avoid previous analysis mistakes.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,"Data sciences, analysis & viz.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3526114.3558530,,USA,WEIRD,,

A thematic analysis of 247 problem instances (80 from programmers and 167 from non-programmers) yielded the following themes, with problems related to condition blocks, action blocks, states and actions, time-related tasks, block configuration and personalisation, information architecture, programming logic, conceptual model of smart homes, simulator and debugging, help and technical problems. Despite most non-programmers being able to experiment with blocks, their task completion rates were significantly lower than programmers. The analysis showed aspects where block-based programming can enhance the use for non-programmers. They also confirmed interaction aspects revealed by previous studies using form-based and data-flow approaches that also occur with block-based programming to design smart home rules, with important contributions to improve end-user development tools for smart homes.",Empirical Studies,YES,NO,Smart objects and environments,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354327825_End-user_development_of_smart_home_rules_using_block-based_programming_a_comparative_usability_evaluation_with_programmers_and_non-programmers,Brazil,Brazil,Non-WEIRD,Yes,no

We selected 165 papers found through a manual selection of papers from specific conferences, journal special issues, and books, integrated with an automatic search on the most important digital libraries. The answer to our research question was built through a classification of the selected papers on seven dimensions: type of approach, interaction technique, phase in which the approach is adopted, application domain, target use, class of users, and type of evaluation. Our findings suggest that EUD, EUP and EUSE are active research topics not only in Human–Computer Interaction, but also in other research communities.

HeyTeddy guides users during hardware assembly by providing additional information on requests or by interactively presenting the assembly steps to build a circuit. Furthermore, the user can program and execute code in real-time on their Arduino platform without having to write any code, but instead by using commands triggered by voice or text via chat. Finally, the system also presents a set of test capabilities for enhancing debugging with custom and proactive unit tests. We codesigned the system with 10 users over 6 months and tested it with realistic physical computing tasks. With the result of two user studies, we show that conversational programming is feasible and that voice is a suitable alternative for programming simple logic and encouraging exploration.

In recent years, no-code and low-code methods have become the mainstream EUD methods that have been widely concerned by the education and business community, due to their low technical barriers. However, there lacks a comprehensive summary of existing research to answer some fundamental questions, such as: How can no/low-code platform help end-users develop ML applications? what are their effects, design methods, and user experience? This paper answers the above questions through a systematic literature review.

A long-standing challenge in PBE is the inherent ambiguity in user-provided examples. This paper presents an interaction model to disambiguate user intent and reduce the cognitive load of understanding and validating synthesized programs. Our model provides two types of augmentations to user-given examples: 1) semantic augmentation where a user can specify how different aspects of an example should be treated by a synthesizer via light-weight annotations, and 2) data augmentation where the synthesizer generates additional examples to help the user understand and validate synthesized programs. We implement and demonstrate this interaction model in the domain of regular expressions, which is a popular mechanism for text processing and data wrangling and is often considered hard to master even for experienced programmers. A within-subjects user study with twelve participants shows that, compared with only inspecting and annotating synthesized programs, interacting with augmented examples significantly increases the success rate of finishing a programming task with less time and increases users? confidence of synthesized programs.",Tool Tech,YES,YES,Programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3379337.3415900,USA,USA,WEIRD,Yes,

Most of the new collaborative robot manipulators come with intuitive programming interfaces that allow novice users to compose robot programs and tune their parameters. However, parameters like motion speeds or exerted forces cannot be easily demonstrated and often require manual tuning, resulting in a tedious trial-and-error process. To address this problem, we formulate tuning of one-dimensional parameters as an Active Learning problem where the learner iteratively refines its estimate of the feasible range of parameter values, by selecting informative queries. By executing the parametrized actions, the learner gathers the user's feedback, in the form of directional answers (higher,'' lower,'' or fine''), and integrates it in the estimate. We propose an Active Learning approach based on Expected Divergence Maximization for this setting and compare it against two baselines with synthetic data. We further compare the approaches on a real-robot dataset obtained from programs written with a simple Domain-Specific Language for a robot arm and manually tuned by expert users (N=8) to perform four manipulation tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness and usability of our interactive tuning approach against manual tuning with a user study where novice users (N=8) tuned parameters of a human-robot hand-over program.",Empirical Studies,YES,YES,Robots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3319502.3374784,Finland / USA,"Finland, USA",WEIRD,Yes,

This is due to the fact that when supporting an end-user in the preparation of even only one dish, various devices may need to coordinate with each other. Additionally, it is challenging— yet desirable—to enable an end-user to program their kitchen devices according to their preferred behaviour and to allow them to visualise and track their cooking workflows. In this paper, we compared two semantic representations, namely, Behaviour Trees and the DX-MAN model. We analysed these representations based on their suitability for a range of end-users (i.e., novice to experienced). The methodology required the analysis of smart kitchen user requirements, from which we inferred that the main architectural requirements for IoT cooking workflows are variability and compositionality. Guided by the user requirements, we examined various scenarios and analysed workflow complexity and feasibility for each representation. On the one hand, we found that execution complexity tends to be higher on Behaviour Trees. However, due to their fallback node, they provide more transparency on how to recover from unprecedented circumstances. On the other hand, parameter complexity tends to be somewhat higher for the DX-MAN model. Nevertheless, the DX-MAN model can be favourable due to its compositionality aspect and the ease of visualisation it can offer.",Empirical Studies,NO,NA,Smart objects and environments,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9643758,,UK,WEIRD,,

While the simplicity of trigger-action programming can be effective for non-programmers with its straightforward concepts and graphical user interface, it does not allow the algorithmic expressivity that a programming language has. For instance, the simple if-this-then-that structure cannot cover complex algorithms that arise from real world scenarios involving multiple conditions or keeping track of a sequence of conditions (e.g., incrementing counters, triggering one action if two conditions are both true). In this exploratory work, we take an alternative approach by creating a programmable channel between application programming interfaces (APIs), which allows programmers to preserve states and to use them to write complex algorithms. We propose iThem, which stands for intelligence of them—internet of things, that allow programmers to author any complex algorithms that can connect different IoT services and fully unleash the freedom of a general programming language.

To reach the full potential of an assistant, it is desirable that individuals can create skills to automate their personal web browsing routines. Many seemingly simple routines, however, such as monitoring COVID-19 stats for their hometown, detecting changes in their child's grades online, or sending personally-addressed messages to a group, cannot be automated without conventional programming concepts such as conditional and iterative evaluation. This paper presents VASH (Voice Assistant Scripting Helper), a new system that empowers users to create useful web-based virtual assistant skills without learning a formal programming language. With VASH, the user demonstrates their task of interest in the browser and issues a few voice commands, such as naming the skills and adding conditions on the action. VASH turns these multi-modal specifications into skills that can be invoked invoice on a virtual assistant. These skills are represented in a formal programming language we designed called WebTalk, which supports parameterization, function invocation, conditionals, and iterative execution. VASH is a fully working prototype that works on the Chrome browser on real-world websites.

Together they form the popular Excel-VBA application ecosystem. Despite being popular, spreadsheets are known to be fault-prone, and to minimize risk of faults in the overall Excel-VBA ecosystem, it is important to support end-user programmers in improving the code quality of their VBA programs also, in addition to improving spreadsheet technology and practices. In traditional software development, automatic code inspection using static analysis tools has been found effective in improving code quality, but the practical relevance of this technique in an end-user development context remains unexplored. With the aim of popularizing it in the end-user community, in this paper we examine the relevance of automatic code inspection in terms of how inspection rules are perceived by VBA programmers. We conduct a qualitative study consisting of interviews with 14 VBA programmers, who share their perceptions about 20 inspection rules that most frequently detected code quality issues in an industrial dataset of 25 VBA applications, obtained from a financial services company. Results show that the 20 studied inspection rules can be grouped into three categories of user perceptions based on the type of issues they warn about: i) 11 rules that warn about serious problems which need fixing, ii) 7 rules that warn about bad practices which do not mandate fixing, and iii) 2 rules that warn about purposeful code elements rather than issues. Based on these perceptions, we conclude that automatic code inspection is considerably relevant in an end-user development context such as VBA. The perceptions also indicate which inspection rules deserve the most attention from interested researchers and tool developers.

To maximize pedagogical effectiveness, some educators advocate teaching students to refactor by hand to elucidate the mechanics behind refactoring instead of relying on tools that transform code automatically. In this position paper, we argue that this pedagogical approach is counterproductive. We advocate teaching refactoring similarly to compilation, a technique that students start applying automatically right away, but learn its inner workings only much later in the curriculum. Even professional developers are advised to avoid carrying out complex refactoring transformations by hand, as this activity leads to hard-to-trace bugs as well as wastes time and effort.

Through higher-level abstractions citizen developers are enabled to develop increasingly complex software systems. While this improves productivity and efficiency it also introduces new challenges in the development process. The evolution of the low-code development platform and the applications built on top of it is one of those challenges. Understanding the impact of changes on the software system is crucial for both the maintenance as well as the improvement of running software. Citizen developers can be supported by direct feedback that reflects how their changes impact the system. Professional developers can use the impact analysis to correctly migrate existing data. Finally, the operations engineers that are responsible for the availability of the platform and the applications can plan seamless upgrades of new versions. Impact analysis should be at the foundations of the development of low-code development platforms. This paper proposes the Impact Analysis for Low-Code Development Platforms framework, a conceptual framework that supports the discussion, research, and implementation of impact analysis.

However, our formative study found that end users would often use unclear, ambiguous or vague concepts when naturally instructing tasks in natural language, especially when specifying conditionals. Existing systems have limited support for letting the user teach agents new concepts or explaining unclear concepts. In this paper, we describe a new multi-modal domain-independent approach that combines natural language programming and programming-by-demonstration to allow users to first naturally describe tasks and associated conditions at a high level, and then collaborate with the agent to recursively resolve any ambiguities or vagueness through conversations and demonstrations. Users can also define new procedures and concepts by demonstrating and referring to contents within GUIs of existing mobile apps.

151,10.1145/3331152,PWA-EU: Extending PWA Approach for Promoting Customization Based on User Preferences,"Progressive Web App (PWA) is a new approach to the development of mobile applications (apps) which was proposed by Google in 2015. It combines technology resources of both web and native apps. Meta-design is an End-User Development (EUD) approach from which end-users participate actively in a system's design process. Yet, PWAs are a recent technology and the impacts of associating EUD and PWAs has been little exploited. As the traditional PWA approach is limited regarding users acting as co-designers, we propose the PWA-EU approach, an extension of the traditional PWA architecture that includes EUD concepts. PWA-EU provides contributions in two lenses. First, the proposal was designed to be used by developers on the design/development time. Second, the app developed using PWA-EU approach will allow end-users to select design preferences, which makes them participants of the app's design. This active participation of end-users on the design is possible due to the meta-design concepts present on the PWA-EU approach. In this article, we present the PWA-EU approach and its evaluation in the perspective of developers/designers. For the evaluation, we grouped participants according to their professional background. The results also indicate that novice developers had a reasonable performance with only one hour of training.We conclude that even novice developers could achieve better performance in a real-life environment, in which they would have more time.",Tool Tech,YES,No,Interaction design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3331152,Brazil,Brazil,Non-WEIRD,Yes,no
152,10.1145/3359619.3359743,Python Programmers Have GPUs Too: Automatic Python Loop Parallelization with Staged Dependence Analysis,"Python is a popular language for end-user software development in many application domains. End-users want to harness parallel compute resources effectively, by exploiting commodity manycore technology including GPUs. However, existing approaches to parallelism in Python are esoteric, and generally seem too complex for the typical end-user developer. We argue that implicit, or automatic, parallelization is the best way to deliver the benefits of manycore to end-users, since it avoids domain-specific languages, specialist libraries, complex annotations or restrictive language subsets. Auto-parallelization fits the Python philosophy, provides effective performance, and is convenient for non-expert developers. Despite being a dynamic language, we show that Python is a suitable target for auto-parallelization. In an empirical study of 3000+ open-source Python notebooks, we demonstrate that typical loop behaviour ‘in the wild’ is amenable to auto-parallelization. We show that staging the dependence analysis is an effective way to maximize performance. We apply classical dependence analysis techniques, then leverage the Python runtime’s rich introspection capabilities to resolve additional loop bounds and variable types in a just-in-time manner. The parallel loop nest code is then converted to CUDA kernels for GPU execution. We achieve orders of magnitude speedup over baseline interpreted execution and some speedup (up to 50x, although not consistently) over CPU JIT-compiled execution, across 12 loop-intensive standard benchmarks.",Empirical Studies,NO,NA,Programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359619.3359743,,UK,WEIRD,,

Despite apparent simplicity, such tools present their own set of issues. The emerging and increasing complexity of the Internet of Things, for example, is barely taken into account, and the number of possible combinations between triggers and actions of different smart devices and web applications is continuously growing. Such a large design space makes end-user personalization a complex task for non-programmers, and motivates the need of assisting users in easily discovering and managing rules and functionality, e.g., through recommendation techniques. In this article, we tackle the emerging problem of recommending IF-THEN rules to end users by presenting RecRules, a hybrid and semantic recommendation system. Through a mixed content and collaborative approach, the goal of RecRules is to recommend by functionality: it suggests rules based on their final purposes, thus overcoming details like manufacturers and brands. The algorithm uses a semantic reasoning process to enrich rules with semantic information, with the aim of uncovering hidden connections between rules in terms of shared functionality. Then, it builds a collaborative semantic graph, and it exploits different types of path-based features to train a learning to rank algorithm and compute top-N recommendations. We evaluate RecRules through different experiments on real user data extracted from IFTTT, one of the most popular EUD tools. Results are promising: they show the effectiveness of our approach with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms and open the way for a new class of recommender systems for EUD that take into account the actual functionality needed by end users.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,Smart objects and environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3344211,,Italy,WEIRD,,

Indeed, in interview studies notebook authors have attested to performing on-going tidying and big cleanups. However, many notebook authors are not trained as software developers, and environments like JupyterLab possess few features to aid notebook maintenance. As software refactoring is traditionally a critical tool for reducing technical debt, we sought to better understand the unique and growing ecology of computational notebooks by investigating the refactoring of public Jupyter notebooks. We randomly selected 15,000 Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHub and studied 200 with meaningful commit histories. We found that notebook authors do refactor, favoring a few basic classic refactorings as well as those involving the notebook cell construct. Those with a computing background refactored differently than others, but not more so. Exploration-focused notebooks had a unique refactoring profile compared to more exposition-focused notebooks. Authors more often refactored their code as they went along, rather than deferring maintenance to big cleanups. These findings point to refactoring being intrinsic to notebook development.",Empirical Studies,NO,NA,Programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3576036,,USA,WEIRD,,

To break through this barrier, future systems must allow users to easily adapt the system by themselves. For humans the most natural way to communicate is talking. But what if users want to extend the systems' functionality with nothing but natural language? Then intelligent systems must understand how laypersons teach new skills. To grasp the semantics of such teaching sequences, we have defined a hierarchical classification task. On the first level, we consider the existence of a teaching intent in an utterance; on the second, we classify the distinct semantic parts of teaching sequences: declaration of a new function, specification of intermediate steps, and superfluous information. We evaluate twelve machine learning techniques with multiple configurations tailored to this task ranging from classical approaches such as naïve-bayes to modern techniques such as bidirectional LSTMs and task-oriented adaptations. On the first level convolutional neural networks achieve the best accuracy (96.6%). For the second task, bidirectional LSTMs are the most accurate (98.8%).

However, robot programming faces high entry barriers due to the complexity of robot programming itself. Even for experts robot programming is a cumbersome and error-prone task where faulty robot programs can be created, causing damage when being executed on a real robot. To simplify the process of robot programming, we combine Augmented Reality (AR) with principles of end-user development. By combining them, the real environment is extended with useful virtual artifacts that can enable experts as well as non-professionals to perform complex robot programming tasks. Therefore, Simple Programming Environment in Augmented Reality with Enhanced Debugging (SPEARED) was developed as a prototype for an AR-assisted robot programming environment. SPEARED makes use of AR to project a robot as well as a programming environment onto the target working space.

Allowing end users, such as shop floor workers, to program collaborative robots themselves would make it easy to “retask” robots from one process to another, facilitating their adoption by small and medium enterprises. Our approach builds on the paradigm of trigger-action programming (TAP) by allowing end users to create rich interactions through simple trigger-action pairings. It enables end users to iteratively create, edit, and refine a reactive robot program while executing partial programs. This live programming approach enables the user to utilize the task space and objects by incrementally specifying situated trigger-action pairs, substantially lowering the barrier to entry for programming or reprogramming robots for collaboration. We instantiate situated live programming in an authoring system where users can create trigger-action programs by annotating an augmented video feed from the robot’s perspective and assign robot actions to trigger conditions. We evaluated this system in a study where participants (n = 10) developed robot programs for solving collaborative light-manufacturing tasks. Results showed that users with little programming experience were able to program HRC tasks in an interactive fashion and our situated live programming approach further supported individualized strategies and workflows.

Thus, companies aim for a more efficient development of more effective applications since domain experts as so-called citizen developers are no longer limited by the availability and domain knowledge of trained software developers. Nevertheless, efficiency and effectiveness of application development is traditionally also largely influenced by the use of a suitable software development method. Domain experts are, however, not trained in software development methods. This introduces a risk of domain experts creating unusable applications or exceeding the designated time frame of a project (or both). In this paper, we therefore propose an initial version of a situational software development method which supports domain experts in manufacturing companies during the low-code development of applications.

Among others, they are used to capture business-related requirements and provide the basis for the development of process-oriented applications in low-code/no-code settings. To support modelers in creating, checking, and maintaining process models, dedicated tools are available. While these tools are generally considered as indispensable to capture process models for their later use, the initial version of a process model is often sketched on a whiteboard or a piece of paper. This has been found to have great advantages, especially with respect to communication and collaboration. It, however, also creates the need to subsequently transform the model sketch into a digital counterpart that can be further processed by modeling and analysis tools. Therefore, to automate this task, various so-called sketch recognition approaches have been defined in the past. Yet, these existing approaches are too limited for use in practice, since they, for instance, require sketches to be created on a digital device or do not address the recognition of edges or textual labels. Against this background, we use this paper to introduce Sketch2Process, the first end-to-end sketch recognition approach for process models captured using BPMN. Sketch2Process uses a neural network-based architecture to recognize the shapes, edges, and textual labels of highly expressive process models, covering 25 types of BPMN elements.

Proposed node model consists of three layers: sensor, logic, and cloud layer. Sensor layer abstract communication with attached sensors and actuators. Similarly, cloud layer abstract communication with servers, usually in cloud. Sensor and cloud layers use configuration files with definitions of its interfaces. Logic layer execute end-user made program that represent node's behavior. Simple syntax is proposed for program so it can be created or adapted by some end-users, not just professional programmers but also automation enthusiasts. Program uses abstractions defined in sensor's and cloud's layers to perform required operations. Proposed node model is compared to other solutions in the IoT field. Advantages of proposed model include simpler design of custom IoT node and system, flexibility in network design, not relaying on Internet connection, while its downsides include complexity of middleware, capabilities when compared to implementation in a programming language, simplicity of creation when compared to solutions with graphical user interface.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,Smart objects and environments,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9597111,,Croatia,WEIRD,,

End-user tuning with feedback is a useful controller feature in settings where robots have to be re-programmed for varying task requirements but end-users do not have programming knowledge. The two controllers we propose are both receding-horizon controllers that differ in their objective function, and their user specified parameters, and subsequently their user-interface: One controller uses a minimum cumulative jerk (MCJ) objective function, and the other a minimum cumulative error (MCE) objective function. We implemented the controllers on a collaborative robot and conducted two controlled experiments to compare the user experience and performance of these controllers vis-à-vis a baseline proportional velocity (PV) controller. In each experiment, participants (n = 30) interactively tuned the controller parameters, and collaborated with a robot to perform a time-constrained repetitive task. We found that the timing controller with the MCE implementation can provide a better user experience, both while setting the parameters (p =0.011) and performing the handovers with the robot (p < 0.001), and fewer failures (p =0.016) compared to the PV controller, however the MCJ implementation did not provide better user experience compared to the PV controller. The MCJ controller also resulted in more failures than the PV controller.

However, data analysts currently lack tool support for recording and reasoning about domain assumptions, data collection, and modeling choices in an integrated manner, leading to mistakes that can compromise scientific validity. For instance, generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) help answer complex research questions, but omitting random effects impairs the generalizability of results. To address this need, we present Tisane, a mixed-initiative system for authoring generalized linear models with and without mixed-effects. Tisane introduces a study design specification language for expressing and asking questions about relationships between variables. Tisane contributes an interactive compilation process that represents relationships in a graph, infers candidate statistical models, and asks follow-up questions to disambiguate user queries to construct a valid model.

However, this malleability is typically only accessible to programmers with knowledge of HTML and Javascript. Previously, we developed a tool called Wildcard which empowers end-users to customize websites through a spreadsheet-like table interface without doing traditional programming. However, there is a limit to end-user agency with Wildcard, because programmers need to first create site-specific adapters mapping website data to the table interface. This means that end-users can only customize a website if a programmer has written an adapter for it, and cannot extend or repair existing adapters. In this paper, we extend Wildcard with a new system for end-user web scraping for customization. It enables end-users to create, extend and repair adapters, by performing concrete demonstrations of how the website user interface maps to a data table. We describe three design principles that guided our system’s development and are applicable to other end-user web scraping and customization systems: (a) users should be able to scrape data and use it in a single, unified environment, (b) users should be able to extend and repair the programs that scrape data via demonstration and (c) users should receive live feedback during their demonstrations. We have successfully used our system to create, extend and repair adapters by demonstration on a variety of websites and we provide example usage scenarios that showcase each of our design principles. Our ultimate goal is to empower end-users to customize websites in the course of their daily use in an intuitive and flexible way, and thus making the web more malleable for all of its users.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,Interaction design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3464432.3464437,,USA,WEIRD,,

In this paper, we unite these approaches. We introduce and evaluate Trace2TAP, a novel method for automatically synthesizing TAP rules from traces (time-stamped logs of sensor readings and manual actuations of devices). We present a novel algorithm that uses symbolic reasoning and SAT-solving to synthesize TAP rules from traces. Compared to prior approaches, our algorithm synthesizes generalizable rules more comprehensively and fully handles nuances like out-of-order events. Trace2TAP also iteratively proposes modified TAP rules when users manually revert automations. We implemented our approach on Samsung SmartThings. Through formative deployments in ten offices, we developed a clustering/ranking system and visualization interface to intelligibly present the synthesized rules to users. We evaluated Trace2TAP through a field study in seven additional offices. Participants frequently selected rules ranked highly by our clustering/ranking system.

Spreadsheets users create new spreadsheets based on existing ones and reuse data layout and computational logic, so there are multiple versions of spreadsheets. End-users have no background of professional programming skills. That is why they are not well aware of the importance of version control and keeping the record of previous documents. So, the version information is usually missing, and it creates a lot of mess when some error is found in one spreadsheet that needs to be resolved in all of its other versions, and it becomes almost impossible when users deal with a very large number of spreadsheets. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to cluster spreadsheets and find different versions of spreadsheets based on the similarity of headers present in spreadsheets. The header detection is not done in a conventional way that is present in literature, but we use font attributes in order to detect headers. We applied our approach on 40 spreadsheets randomly selected from spreadsheet corpora like Enron, FUSE, and EUSES.

The Web has become the main source of information for millions of users. The number of websites offering content to users is countless. In order to personalise information according to their needs, users often have to visit multiple, unconnected pages. Users perform a number of actions to collect that information that requires concentration. If the number of Web resources is large, the activity becomes unpleasant. The problem increases when these tasks are performed frequently and repetitively. These tasks are time-consuming and lead users to experience frustration and disorientation during the activity, causing a loss of concentration that prolongs the activity over time. Web Augmentation combines different Web technologies to improve user experience on existing pages by adding content from different pages among other benefits.

We performed a user study (N=15) with children aged 7-12, using a block-based, gamified AR spatial coding prototype allowing to manipulate smart artifacts in an Intelligent Living room. Our results validated that children understand and can indeed program IEs. Based on our findings, we contribute preliminary implications regarding the use of specific technologies and paradigms (e.g. AR, trigger-action programming) to inspire future systems that enable children to create enriching experiences in IEs.",Empirical Studies,YES,YES,AR/VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3459990.3462463,Greece,Greece,WEIRD,Yes,
217,10.1145/3350546.3352558,WoTDL: Web of Things Description Language for Automatic Composition,"Enabling end users to take a proactive role in the development of Web of Things (WoT) applications that achieves their goals is a challenge for End User Development (EUD) in the context of WoT. This can be achieved through Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning algorithms if the relevant WoT concepts and relationships are described in an interoperable way. Although similar, existing service description languages like WSDL or ontologies like OWL-S are not sufficient to represent all required characteristics of concrete WoT planning scenarios. To address these limitations, in this paper we present the Web of Things Description Language (WoTDL) ontology which is an extension of existing WoT models to describe the key concepts of AI planning for automatic WoT composition. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we follow the best practices recommended by the semantic web community and describe the physical devices of our smart home testbed in an AI planning scenario using WoTDL.",Tool Tech,NO,NA,Smart objects and environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3350546.3352558,,Germany,WEIRD,,
